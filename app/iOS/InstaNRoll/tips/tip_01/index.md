# A short guide about CinnaRoll's usage

This App is mainly for `Instagram` posting horizontal scrolling long image.
With all kinds of photo devices, even cell phones, the resolution of photos taken nowadays has become higher, and when enlarging images on Retina screen devices, they are generally in the acceptable and spreadable range of sharpness. This leaves a lot of room for decomposition and post-cropping of photos.

On `Instagram`, posting `1:1` or `4:5` ratio photos can make good use of the post space, however, if posting `5:4` and `40:21` ratio horizontal wide images, the screen utilization will be very low. When you want to show more details in non-landscape photos, or make interesting compositions, cutting a horizontal image into multiple smaller images is a good way. Indeed, some users do this way. When I search for the question *"How to make a seamless Instagram panorama"*, there are a lot of good tutorials, but they are all about `Photoshop` that the process is tedious and uncommon, and most importantly you have to use a personal computer to do it.

Ta-da! With `CinnaRoll` you can forget about these worries. Take a look at the following small examples:

## Rebounding is my world

Open the original image to be sliced

The original setting was to crop it into two photos at a 1:1 ratio.
This photo already looks good in two slices, but for a larger display area, try a single 4:5 ratio here.

There is a piece in the bottom center that is not needed for the composition, so move it out of the way.

Finally, tap the angle rotation button and check the accuracy of the horizontal line.

## Other Tips	

- If you don't need to automatically save the image before slicing, you can turn it off in the settings.

- If you are familiar with the process and want to make the user interface more simple, you can turn on the "Reduce button description" switch in the settings.
